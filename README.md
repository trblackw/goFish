# goFish
**Why?**

I'm building goFish with the intention of easing the process of one's search for information on a given topic. Everyone loves Google, myself included, but often times a Google search can turn into a Google journey when trying to discern certain information. I'm attempting to remedy this with goFish through providing users with potentially an all-in-one tool for aggregating their search data, with registered users being able to archive previous searches, with the potential (development process permitting) to expand and build upon those searches as well as enhance them.

**Technologies**

I'm in love with React, and lately I've been diving deep into [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). Thus, goFish's front end is built entirely with Hooks, making use of both context and the redux-like paradigm of state management via the useReducer hook. The backend is built on express, utilizing json webtokens and passport for authentication, pooling from a mongodb database. I've also recently found [Tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/) for which I've grown quite fond of. For testing, I reach for (and love) Jest.

**Open to pull requests**

I'd love to collaborate! Feel free to contribute -- it's a work in progress!
